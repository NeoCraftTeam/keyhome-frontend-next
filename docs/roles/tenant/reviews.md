# Reviews

## Feature Description

Authenticated tenants can submit **property reviews** after interacting with a listing (typically after a confirmed viewing). Reviews include a star rating (1-5) and an optional text comment. Reviews are visible on the ad detail page and in the owner's review management dashboard.

---

## User Journey

1. Authenticated tenant navigates to an ad detail page (`/ads/[slug]`)
2. Scrolls to the "Avis & Notes" (Reviews) section
3. If eligible (has had a confirmed viewing or purchased an unlock), the "Laisser un avis" form is visible
4. Tenant selects a star rating (1–5) and optionally writes a comment
5. Clicks "Soumettre" → `POST /reviews` is called
6. On success → the review appears immediately in the list
7. The overall rating on the listing is updated
