# Owner / Bailleur Role

## Description

An **Owner** (also *Bailleur* or *Agent* in the UI, `UserRole.AGENT` in the codebase) is an authenticated user who lists and manages properties on KeyHome. Owners can be **individuals** (`UserType.INDIVIDUAL`) or **agencies** (`UserType.AGENCY`).

The Owner panel lives entirely under the `/owner/*` route group, which uses its own layout (`OwnerThemeProvider`), its own authentication flow, and is protected by a role cookie set by the middleware.
