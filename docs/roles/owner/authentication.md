# Owner Authentication

## Feature Description

Owners (Bailleurs/Agents) have a **dedicated authentication flow** completely separate from the customer flow. The owner panel lives under `/owner/*` and uses its own login, registration, and OAuth callback pages. When an owner logs in, a **role cookie** is set to ensure the middleware routes them to the correct panel.

---

## Owner Registration Flow

Owners can register as either:
- **Individual (`UserType.INDIVIDUAL`)** — a private landlord
- **Agency (`UserType.AGENCY`)** — a real estate agency

```
/owner/register
  │
  ├── Step 1: Account type selection (Individual / Agency)
  ├── Step 2: Personal details (name, email, phone, password)
  ├── Step 3: Agency details (if agency type: name, registration number)
  ├── Step 4: City selection
  │
  └── POST /auth/registerAgent → { access_token, user }
          │
          └── Email verification → /verify-email → OTP → finalize
```

---

## Owner Login Flow

```
/owner/login
  │
  ├── POST /auth/login (login_context: 'owner')
  │       └── { access_token, user, role: 'agent', type }
  │
  ├── setRoleCookie('agent')   ← Middleware reads this to guard /owner/* routes
  │
  └── redirect → /owner/dashboard
```

---

## OAuth Flow (Owner)

Owners can also use social login (same Clerk OAuth providers as customers). The `/owner/auth` page handles the OAuth callback:

```
/owner/auth (OAuth callback)
  │
  ├── POST /auth/clerk/exchange
  │
  ├── if new user → /complete-profile or /verify-otp
  │
  └── if agent role → setRoleCookie('agent') → /owner/dashboard
```

---

## Middleware Role Guard

`src/proxy.ts` enforces that:
- `/owner/*` routes require `role=agent` cookie → 403 or redirect to `/owner/login` for non-owners
- Authenticated customers visiting `/owner/*` are redirected to `/home`
- Authenticated owners visiting customer routes (`/profile`, `/home`) are redirected to `/owner/dashboard`

```typescript
// src/proxy.ts (inferred logic)
if (pathname.startsWith('/owner') && !isOwnerRole) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/owner/login', request.url));
}
if (!pathname.startsWith('/owner') && isOwnerRole && isPrivateCustomerRoute) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/owner/dashboard', request.url));
}
```
