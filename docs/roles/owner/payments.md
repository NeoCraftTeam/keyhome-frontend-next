# Payments

## Feature Description

The KeyHome payment system uses **Flutterwave** as the payment gateway, supporting mobile money (Orange Money, MTN MoMo), card payments, and other regional payment methods. Payments are used for:

1. **Ad Boost** — Promote a listing to the top of search results
2. **Credits / Points** — Purchase points to unlock contact information of landlords
3. **Subscriptions** — Buy subscription plans for premium features
4. **Pro Services** — Purchase ad-on professional services

## Payment Flow

```
Owner/Tenant initiates a purchase
  │
  ├── POST /payments/initiate_payment
  │     { type, payment_method, phone_number, ad_id?, plan_id?, period? }
  │
  ├── Response: { reference, payment_link, tx_ref, gateway, status }
  │
  ├── User redirected to payment_link (Flutterwave hosted page)
  │     OR inline payment for mobile money (OTP on phone)
  │
  ├── User completes payment → Flutterwave redirects to /payment-success?tx_ref=...
  │
  ├── POST /payments/verify_payment { tx_ref }
  │
  └── On success: purchase activated (boost enabled, points credited, subscription active)
```

## Payment Types

| Type | `payment_type` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Unlock contact | `unlock` | Deduct points or initiate payment to see owner contact |
| Ad Boost | `boost` | Promote listing for a set duration |
| Credit Package | `credit` | Buy point packages (e.g. 500 pts for 2,000 XOF) |
| Subscription | `subscription` | Purchase monthly/annual plan |

---

## Credit / Points System

Tenants use **points** (credits) to unlock landlord contact information. Points are purchased via the Flutterwave payment flow.

- **Unlock flow**: `POST /payments/initialize/:adId`
  - If `status === 'unlocked'` → contact info immediately visible (already had enough points)
  - If `status === 'insufficient_points'` → trigger credit purchase flow showing available packages
  - If `status === 'owner'` → user owns this ad (no unlock needed)
  - If `status === 'already_unlocked'` → previously unlocked

```typescript
// src/hooks/usePayment.ts
const { initiatePayment, isLoading, error } = usePayment();

const handleUnlock = async () => {
  const result = await paymentsService.initialize(adId);
  if (result.status === 'insufficient_points') {
    // Show credit packages to purchase
    openCreditModal(result.packages);
  }
};
```

---

## Ad Boost

Owners can boost their listings from the dashboard or `/owner/pro-services`:

```typescript
// src/services/owner.service.ts

// Boost with subscription plan (paid)
await ownerService.boostAd(adId, {
  plan_id: 'boost-plan-uuid',
  callback_url: window.location.origin + '/payment-success',
});

// Self-boost using existing credits (free if eligible)
await ownerService.selfBoostAd(adId, { duration_days: 7 });

// Remove boost
await ownerService.unboostAd(adId);

// Check boost status
const status = await ownerService.getBoostStatus(adId);
// { is_boosted: true, boost_expires_at: '2024-02-01T00:00:00Z' }
```

---

## Subscription Plans

Owners can subscribe to premium plans at `/owner/subscriptions`:

```typescript
// src/services/subscriptions.service.ts
const plans = await subscriptionsService.getPlans();
// GET /subscriptions/plans → SubscriptionPlan[]

const current = await subscriptionsService.getCurrent();
// GET /subscriptions/current → CurrentSubscription | null
```

---

## Payment History

Both tenants (at `/payments`) and owners (at `/owner/payments`) can view their payment history:

```typescript
// src/services/payments.service.ts
const history = await paymentsService.getHistory({ page: 1 });
// GET /payments/history → { data: PaymentHistoryItem[], meta }
```

### PaymentHistoryItem

```typescript
interface PaymentHistoryItem {
  id: string;
  reference: string;          // Flutterwave transaction reference
  status: PaymentStatus;      // pending | success | failed
  type: PaymentType;          // unlock | subscription | boost | credit
  amount: number;             // Amount in XOF/XAF
  gateway: PaymentGateway;    // flutterwave | stripe
  ad: Ad | null;              // Associated listing (for unlock/boost)
  created_at: string;
}
```

---

## Payment Success Page

After Flutterwave redirects back, the `/payment-success` page:
1. Reads `tx_ref` from the URL query parameters
2. Calls `POST /payments/verify_payment { tx_ref }`
3. Shows success/failure UI
4. Redirects the user to the appropriate page
