# KeyHome Frontend — Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

**KeyHome** is a pan-African real estate marketplace targeting West African markets (XOF/XAF currency zones — Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Senegal, etc.). The frontend is a Next.js 16 Progressive Web App that enables property seekers, landlords/agents, and platform administrators to search, list, book viewings, and manage rental contracts.

## Architecture

### App Router & Route Groups

The application uses Next.js App Router with four distinct route groups, each with its own layout and authentication context:

```
src/app/
├── (auth)/           # Unauthenticated auth flows (login, register, verify)
├── (dashboard)/      # Authenticated customer experience
├── (owner)/          # Owner/Agent management panel
├── (landing)/        # Marketing & public pages
├── layout.tsx        # Root layout (ClerkProvider, PWA, analytics)
├── page.tsx          # Landing page redirect
└── [...slug]/        # Catch-all for dynamic public pages
```

### Middleware (CSP & Route Guards)

`src/proxy.ts` acts as Clerk-powered middleware with:
- Per-request **nonce-based Content Security Policy** headers
- **Role-based route protection** (owner cookie guard, customer path guards)
- Automatic redirects for authenticated users on the landing page

### Authentication Architecture

The app supports **dual authentication**:
1. **Laravel Sanctum** (email/password) — primary for customers and owners
2. **Clerk** (OAuth/social) — Google, Facebook, Apple via redirect flow

The `AuthProvider` manages in-memory token storage (XSS protection), session migrations, role-based redirects, and a 3.5-second logout overlay.

### Data Fetching

All API calls go through a central Axios instance in `src/lib/api.ts`:
- Automatic **CSRF token** fetching for Sanctum
- **401 auth-expired** event dispatch
- **419 CSRF retry** logic
- **30-second timeout** with per-request override support

TanStack Query wraps all data fetching with:
- `staleTime: 5 minutes`
- `gcTime: 10 minutes`
- No retry on 401/403
- No refetch on window focus

| **Tenant / Customer** | Authenticated user searching & booking properties | `/home` |
| **Owner / Agent (Bailleur)** | Property owner or agency managing listings | `/owner/dashboard` |
| **Admin** | Platform administrator | `/admin` (Filament panel via SSO) |
